## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at 
<a href="https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/">SkyLab</a>, 
<a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">University of California, Berkeley</a>.
where I work with with <a href="https://nacrooks.github.io/">Dr. Natacha Crooks</a>. 
I will be joining <a href="https://scds.uoregon.edu/cs">Department of Computer Science</a>, 
<a href="https://www.uoregon.edu/">University of Oregon</a> as a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor from Fall 2024.
<br>

My research focusses on designing efficient decentralized systems that can handle arbitrary failures 
and can scale across the WAN.
<br>

Previously, I was awarded Ph.D. degree at 
<a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a>, 
<a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/">University of California, Davis</a>. 
I also serve as the Lead Architect for <a href="https://resilientdb.com/">ResilientDB</a>, which I founded 
during my Ph.D at UC Davis.
<br>

I was awarded Best Graduate Researcher Award by UC Davis for my thesis, titled, 
<i>Resilient and Scalable Architecture for Permissioned Blockchain Fabrics</i>. 
During my Ph.D. I also authored a book titled, 
<i>Fault-Tolerant Distributed Transactions on Blockchain</i>, which was published by Morgan & Claypool as part of Synthesis Lectures on Data Management 
(also available now with Springer).
<br>

I started my PhD at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/">Purdue University</a> 
in August 2015 and transferred to <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/">University of California Davis</a> 
in January 2018. At UC Davis, I was advised by
<a href="https://msadoghi.github.io/">Dr. Mohammad Sadoghi</a>. 

Prior to moving to UC Davis, I earned couple of master degrees.
I was awarded <i>Master of Science</i> in Computer Science by 
Department of Computer Science at Purdue University in December 2017.
During my time at Purdue, I also worked with <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/">Prof. 
Suresh Jagannathan</a> in the domain of Distributed Systems and Programming Languages, and was
associated with the <a href="http://purduepl.github.io/">PurPL</a> and <a href="https://www.siam.org/students/chapters/current/purdue.php">SIAM</a>.


In more distant past, I worked with <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~krishna/">Dr. V. Krishna Nandivada</a> 
at <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Madras</a>.
At IIT Madras, I was awarded <i>Master of Science (Research)</i> from the Department of CSE.
My masters thesis led to several publications and was titled as 
<i>Analyzing Recursive Task Parallel Programs.</i>.
