## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at 
<a href="https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/">SkyLab</a>, 
<a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">University of California, Berkeley</a>.
I am working with <a href="https://nacrooks.github.io/">Dr. Natacha Crooks</a> on designing efficient fault-tolerant systems 
with a key focus on handling malicious attacks.
<br><br>

Previously, I was awarded Ph.D. degree at 
<a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a>, 
<a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/">University of California, Davis</a>. 
I am also the Lead Architect at <a href="https://resilientdb.com/">ResilientDB</a>, which I founded 
during my Ph.D at UC Davis.
I am also associated with <a href="https://expolab.org/">ExploLab</a>.
